## Background

I've been trying out different blogging platforms from quite a while now. I started out with WordPress, trying dev.to, medium, hashnode alongside. But well nothing suited me.

WordPress was slow even with decent hosting plans, but had a recurring cost which didn't provide enough value for investment. dev.to's primary focus wasn't technical writing, they allow everything: discussions, cross-postings, articles so things seemed cluttered.
