## Background

Bloom was developed to address the specific needs of a prominent educational institution in Sri Lanka, aiming to streamline the management of student information and academic resources. With a focus on enhancing communication and accessibility, Bloom integrates features such as in-app notifications for live classes and payment confirmations, making it easier for students to engage with their educational journey. The app supports local language usage through Sinhala font capabilities, ensuring inclusivity for all users.

## The future

Bloom could be enhanced by:
- Incorporating additional educational tools such as assignment tracking, grading systems and performance analytics to provide a more holistic academic management experience.
- Developing offline access to course materials and recorded sessions to support learning in areas with limited internet connectivity.
