## Background

LABYL aims to enhance architectural discovery through technology. The app enables users to photograph buildings and receive instant identification and information about them. It integrates data from city records and the NYC open data platform, allowing users to explore their surroundings and learn about significant structures in popular neighborhoods like Chelsea and the West Village.

## The future

Looking ahead, LABYL aims to expand its database significantly, incorporating more buildings and neighborhoods beyond New York City. Future updates will focus on enhancing user experience with improved search functionalities, personalized recommendations, and community engagement features that encourage users to contribute additional building information. The long-term vision includes establishing LABYL as a global resource for architectural discovery in cities worldwide.
