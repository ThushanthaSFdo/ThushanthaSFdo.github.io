## Background

This 2D fish-catching game was developed using Swift UIKit combined with SpriteKit and GameplayKit to create an engaging and interactive experience. Players have 30 seconds to catch as many fish as possible, earning points for each catch while avoiding harmful bones that deduct points. The game currently lacks stages but allows players to save their game history for future reference.

## The future

Future updates will introduce three gameplay modes: easy, medium, and hard, catering to different skill levels and enhancing replayability. We plan to implement stage-based challenges to keep players engaged and motivated. Additionally, we will enhance the scoring system to save and display the highest scores, fostering competition among players. Regular updates will also include new fish types and dynamic environments to enrich the gaming experience.
