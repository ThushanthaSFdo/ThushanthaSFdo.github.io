## Background

I've been trying out different blogging platforms from quite a while now. I started out with WordPress, trying dev.to, medium, hashnode alongside. But well nothing suited me.

WordPress was slow even with decent hosting plans, but had a recurring cost which didn't provide enough value for investment. dev.to's primary focus wasn't technical writing, they allow everything: discussions, cross-postings, articles so things seemed cluttered.

## Current stats

The blog is [open source](https://github.com/genicsblog) at heart. And this transparency has lead to a lot of growth, from 200 monthly readers to 700+ within 3 months.

We primarily rely on organic traffic, which constitutes almost half of the total traffic.

## The future

Currently, we are focused on publishing a lot quality content (the reason each submission is reviewed twice before being published).This sets up a solid base for the future. We plan to grow our userbase and keep providing value through content!
