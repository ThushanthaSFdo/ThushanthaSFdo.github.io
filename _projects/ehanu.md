## Background

The app was developed to address inefficiencies in traditional prescription methods, aiming to improve communication between doctors, patients, and pharmacies. By digitizing prescriptions, we reduce paperwork, minimize errors, and facilitate quicker access to medications. The platform empowers patients with more control over their healthcare choices while enabling pharmacies to manage prescriptions efficiently.

## The future

Moving forward, the aim is to enhance the app by implementing advanced features for better handling of partial medicine fulfillment and an enriched prescription history interface. Also will plan to introduce real-time notifications for patients regarding their prescription status and integrate AI-driven insights for personalized medication management. The goal is to foster stronger relationships between healthcare providers and patients while ensuring a more efficient pharmacy experience.
